  	   <h3>A few things about me.</h3>
  	   <p>I have a passion for travel. Whenever I go to a new place I just love exploring and seeing new things. I feel the most important thing about life is experiences.</p>
  	   <p>I also really care about animals. I have grown up helping my dad rescue animals on the street and find them good homes. It is so rewarding.</p>
  	   <p>Lastly I love to dance. There is nothing like letting lose on the dance floor.</p>
